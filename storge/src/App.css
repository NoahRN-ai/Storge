/*
  All styles from the original App.css were related to the default Vite template
  (logos, cards, etc.) and are not used by the Storge chat application.
  The #root styling is handled more appropriately in index.css for centering the app.
  This file can be kept for app-specific layout styles if App.jsx evolves,
  or removed if all global/component styles are handled elsewhere.
  For now, it will be left empty.

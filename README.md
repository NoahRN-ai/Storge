# Storge Family Chat

A simple real-time chat application designed for families, built with modern web technologies.

## Core Technologies

*   **Frontend:** React, Vite
*   **Backend:** Supabase
    *   Database: PostgreSQL (schema managed by migrations)
    *   Authentication (email/password)
    *   Realtime Subscriptions & Presence

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   Node.js (v18 or newer recommended)
*   npm (usually comes with Node.js)
*   Supabase CLI (v1.100.0 or newer recommended) - [Installation Guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started)

## Local Development Setup

Follow these steps to get the Storge application running locally:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/storge.git # Replace with your repo URL
    cd storge
    ```

2.  **Set up Supabase Locally:**
    *   Initialize Supabase (if this is the first time setting up the project in this directory, otherwise skip):
        ```bash
        supabase init
        ```
    *   Start Supabase services (database, auth, storage, etc.):
        ```bash
        supabase start
        ```
        After this command completes, Supabase will output API URL, anon key, and other useful information. You'll need these for the frontend configuration.

3.  **Configure Frontend Environment:**
    *   Navigate to the frontend directory:
        ```bash
        cd storge
        ```
        (If you're not already in the `storge` subdirectory that contains `package.json`)
    *   Install frontend dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   Create a `.env` file for frontend environment variables by copying the example:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    *   Open `storge/.env` and fill in the Supabase details:
        *   `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Get this from the output of `supabase status` (usually `API URL`).
        *   `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Get this from the output of `supabase status` (usually `anon key`).
        The Supabase database schema (including the `profiles` table and user creation trigger) is managed by migration files in `supabase/migrations/`. These are applied automatically when you run `supabase start`.

4.  **Run Frontend Development Server:**
    *   While still in the `storge` (frontend) directory:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    *   Open your browser and navigate to the URL provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

    You should now be able to use the login page and access the chat application.

## Project Structure Overview

*   `README.md`: This file.
*   `storge/`: Contains the frontend React/Vite application.
    *   `public/`: Static assets for the frontend.
    *   `src/`: Frontend source code.
        *   `assets/`: Image assets.
        *   `components/`: React components (`LoginPage.jsx`, `ChatPage.jsx`).
        *   `App.jsx`: Main application component.
        *   `main.jsx`: Entry point for the React application.
        *   `supabaseClient.js`: Initializes the Supabase JavaScript client.
        *   `index.css`: Global styles.
    *   `.env.example`: Example environment variables for the frontend.
    *   `package.json`: Frontend dependencies and scripts.
    *   `vite.config.js`: Vite configuration.
*   `supabase/`: Contains backend Supabase project configuration.
    *   `migrations/`: Contains SQL files for database schema changes. The `profiles` table and related auth trigger are managed here.
    *   `config.toml`: Supabase project configuration for local development.
    *   (Other files/folders generated by `supabase init` like `seed.sql` etc.)

## Further Development

The application now has a solid foundation with email/password authentication and a user profiles system managed by database migrations. Key features like real-time chat and presence are implemented.

Potential next steps could include:
*   **Avatar Uploads:** Allow users to upload avatar images (would involve Supabase Storage).
*   **Enhanced User Profiles:** Add more fields to user profiles (e.g., bio, status message).
*   **Direct Messages:** Implement one-on-one messaging.
*   **Multiple Chat Rooms:** Allow creation and joining of different chat rooms.
*   **Notifications:** Add browser notifications for new messages.
*   **End-to-End Testing:** Implement end-to-end tests using a framework like Playwright or Cypress.
*   **UI/UX Polish:** Further refine styling and user experience.
*   **Custom Favicon:** Design and implement a custom favicon.
